# collab
## Collaborate and get help from coders in real-time.

Collab is an attempt to let people collaborate in real-time. It uses websockets to send code between collaborators. The backend is handled by Tornado.

Collab is still in developing stage. It is not hosted anywhere as of now. However, you can clone and set it up for personal use.  

[Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/) is used for the editor.

### Setup
* Install Tornado
```
  pip3 install tornado
```

* Run collab.py

* Open index.html
